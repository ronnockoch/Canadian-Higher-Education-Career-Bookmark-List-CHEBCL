Ontario Higher Education Career Bookmark List - CHEBCL
======

This is a comprehensive collection of links, importable into your bookmarks in Chrome/Firefox/Netscape/Edge, to non-academic career pages at post-secondary / higher education institutions in Canada.

This includes publicly funded, non-profit institutions.

**Not** included are for-profit, private or institutions which exclusively offer religious degrees.


## Organization

The project folder contains three import files to add all bookmarks at once:
 1. [all-colleges.html](/all-colleges.html)
 2. [all-universities.html](/all-universities.html)
 3. [all-colleges-universities.html](/all-colleges-universities.html)

Each top-level folder (Province or Territory) will be populated with two sub-folders and a file:
4. University
5. College

The file will be something similar to `province-uni-college.html` and contains all the data for listed Higher Education insitutions in that Province or Territory.

Within each folder, you will find a `README.md` and a `bookmark-list.html` file.

The `README.md` will provide a linked list of the career pages in browser, whereas the `province-list.html` file will allow you to import the files into your browser's bookmark manager for quicker access.


## Adding Bookmarks

The `bookmark-list.html` files are setup to be imported into your browser's bookmark manager. The format is, to the best of my knowledge, based off of the Netscape Bookmark file format which is still in use in modern browswers.

The file contains code that will look like the following:
```html
<!DOCTYPE NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1>
<!-- This is an automatically generated file.
     It will be read and overwritten.
     DO NOT EDIT! -->
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
